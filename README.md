# Red Hat Dependency Analytics
Red Hat Dependency Analytics (RHDA) is a Jenkins plug-in developed by **Red Hat Inc**. 

'RHDA Report' with Insights about your application dependencies:
- Flags a security vulnerability(CVE) and suggests a remedial version
- Shows Github popularity metrics along with latest version
- Suggests a project level license, check for conflicts between dependency licences
- AI based guidance for additional, alternative dependencies

The plugin can be used in Jenkins as a pipeline task or as a build step.

## How to use the plugin
### Admin Steps
### 1. Install the redhat-dependency-analytics Jenkins plugin
- From the Jenkins Dashboard, click **Manage Jenkins** -> **Plugins** -> **Available Plugins**.
- If Maven is not installed, search for _Maven Integration_, and install the plug in.
- Search for _redhat-dependency-analytics_, and install the plug in.
- Restart Jenkins.

### 2. Configuration
Make sure that the Path is updated to point to the corresponding executables, like `mvn`, `pip` etc.

#### Customization

To set a custom path for package managers use environment variables.

- Click on Manage Jenkins -> System, scroll down to Global properties/Environment Variables.
- Set the corresponding custom path based on your project: 
  - For Maven - Set Name: _EXHORT_MVN_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/mvn`.
  - For NPM - Set Name: _EXHORT_NPM_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/npm`.
  - For GO - Set Name: _EXHORT_GO_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/go`.
  - For Python3 - Set Name: _EXHORT_PYTHON3_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/python3`.
  - For Pip3 - Set Name: _EXHORT_PIP3_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/pip3`.
  - For Python - Set Name: _EXHORT_PYTHON_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/python`.
  - For Pip - Set Name: _EXHORT_PIP_PATH_ and Value: `/path/to/custom/pip`.

#### General Configuration
 Click <em>Manage Jenkins</em>. Click <em>System</em>, and scroll down to <em>Global properties/Environment Variables</em>. Here you can configure the following settings:
 - name: `EXHORT_DEBUG`, Value: `true` , Description: Will invoke the analysis in verbose mode and will print a lot of useful logs to job output console - good for debugging, Default value is false.


 - name: `EXHORT_DEV_MODE`, value: `true`, Description: Will invoke the Analysis on Staging Instance Of EXHORT Service, Default: false ( EXHORT Production Instance)


 - name: _HIGHEST_ALLOWED_VULN_SEVERITY_, Possible values: [`LOW`,`MEDIUM`,`HIGH`,`CRITICAL`], Description: will determine what is the highest allowed Severity of a vulnerability found for a given package/dependency in the analysis, for the analysis to be considered Successful(RC=0) and not Vulnerable(RC=2), Default value is `MEDIUM`

#### Python Pipeline Configuration
 For Python PIP packages, you can use the specific Python and PIP binaries during the invocation of the analysis. You can also specify these binaries elsewhere in your pipeline jobs, such as a stage environment, or another agent or node. Red Hat Dependency Analytics gives you maximum flexibility with the Python and PIP versions. You do not have to enforce the user to install different Python and PIP versions just to adapt it to the exact `requirements.txt` list of package versions. Python is very sensitive to versioning, for each Python version, there is a limited range of supported versions for a package.
 There are two environment variables:
  1. _EXHORT_PIP_FREEZE_
  2. _EXHORT_PIP_SHOW_ 
 

 This feature enables you to use Python for different agents. For example, a Python container image containing the desired Python version you want to do the analysis with. You can install the input requirements.txt file using PIP within the container image, and then you can use the following commands to generate the output for a files in workspace : pip freeze --all and pip show <list_of_packages>. Next, run base64 to encode the output from these commands, and set the EXHORT_PIP_FREEZE and EXHORT_PIP_SHOW environment variables with that encoded output, respectively.
Example pipeline with proper usage:

```yaml
node {
    def dockerArguments= '--user=root'
    def pipFreezeOutput
    def pipShowOutput
    def pythonImage = "python:${params.PYTHON_VERSION}-slim"
    def gitRepoWithRequirements = "${params.REQUIREMENTS_GIT_REPO}"
    def gitRepoWithRequirementsBranch = "${params.REQUIREMENTS_GIT_BRANCH}"


    stage('Checkout Git Repo') { // for display purposes
        // Get some code from a GitHub repository
        dir('requirementsDir') {
            git  branch: gitRepoWithRequirementsBranch, url: gitRepoWithRequirements
        }

    }

    stage('Install Python Package') {
        docker.withTool('docker-tool') {
            docker.withServer('tcp://localhost:2376','docker-server-certs'){

                docker.image(pythonImage).inside(dockerArguments) {
                    sh 'pip install -r requirementsDir/requirements.txt'
                    pipFreezeOutput = sh(script: "pip freeze --all" ,returnStdout: true ).trim()
                    writeFile([file: 'pip-freeze.txt', text: pipFreezeOutput])
                    pipFreezeOutput = sh(script: "pip freeze --all | awk -F \"==\" '{print \$1}' | tr \"\n\" \" \"" ,returnStdout: true ).trim()
                    pipShowOutput = sh(script:"pip show ${pipFreezeOutput}" ,returnStdout: true )
                    writeFile([file: 'pip-show.txt', text: pipShowOutput])


                }
            }
        }
    }
    stage('RHDA Run Analysis') {
        def pipFreezeB64= sh(script: 'cat pip-freeze.txt | base64 -w0' ,returnStdout: true ).trim()
        def pipShowB64= sh(script: 'cat pip-show.txt | base64 -w0',returnStdout: true ).trim()
        echo "pipFreezeB64= ${pipFreezeB64}"
        echo "pipShowpipShowB64= ${pipShowB64}"
        withEnv(["EXHORT_PIP_FREEZE=${pipFreezeB64}","EXHORT_PIP_SHOW=${pipShowB64}"]) {

            rhdaAnalysis consentTelemetry: true, file: "${WORKSPACE}/requirementsDir/requirements.txt"
        }

    }

    stage('Clean Workspace') {
        cleanWs cleanWhenAborted: false, cleanWhenFailure: false, cleanWhenNotBuilt: false, cleanWhenUnstable: false
    }

}
```
 
 

### Using The Plugin

#### Option 1 - As a build step
- Click on Configure -> Build Trigger -> Add Build Step. Select `Invoke Red Hat Dependency Analytics (RHDA)`.
- Filepath (Mandatory): Provide the filepath for the manifest file. We currently support the following
	- Maven: pom.xml
	- Python: requirements.txt
	- Npm: package.json
	- Golang: go.mod
- Usage Statistics (Optional): Consent given to red hat to collect some usage statistics to improve the plugin and report. Default consent is false.
![](./images/configOption1.png)

  **NOTE:** If you get a Java runtime error because the build can not find the `mvn` binary, try doing the following steps:
  1. From the Jenkins Dashboard, click **Manage Jenkins** -> **Tools** -> **Maven Installations** -> click **Add Maven** -> Enter a name on **Maven Name** -> check **Install automatically** -> click **Save**
  2. From the Jenkins Dashboard, click **Manage Jenkins** -> **System** -> **Check Environment Variables**, click **Add**.
  3. Enter _EXHORT_MVN_PATH_ as the variable name, with the value pointing to the `mvn` binary from the Maven Integration installation.
     For example, a value of `$JENKINS_HOME/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/<Maven Name from Step 1>/bin/mvn`.
  4. Include **Invoke top-level maven targets** as a build step by specifying the Maven version, and add **clean install** as a goal for the new pipeline item.
  
#### Option 2 - As a pipeline task
- Its just a single line that you need to add in your pipeline script.
`rhdaAnalysis file:'manifest file path', consentTelemetry:true`
The value description remains the same as provided in the Option I.
User can also use the pipeline snippet generator to generate the command.

##### Example basic pipeline
**NOTE: The package manager binaries have to be in the pipeline's invoking machine, such as a Jenkins master or agent, for this declarative pipeline to work properly.**
```java

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the Git repository
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: 'main']], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: '[https://github.com/Your github project link.git']]](https://github.com/Your github project link.git)])
            }
        }
        stage ('Install requirements.txt if Python PIP') {
            steps {
                script {
                    if (fileExists('requirements.txt')) {
                        sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('RHDA Step') {
            steps {
                echo 'RHDA'
                rhdaAnalysis consentTelemetry: true, file: 'manifestName.extension'
            }
        }
    }
}


```
